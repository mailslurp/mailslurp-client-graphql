  # Forward email to recipients
  # Forward an existing email to new recipients. The sender of the email will be the inbox that received the email you are forwarding. You can override the sender with the &#x60;from&#x60; option. Note you must have access to the from address in MailSlurp to use the override. For more control consider fetching the email and sending it a new using the send email endpoints.

  # Get email content regex pattern match results. Runs regex against email body and returns match groups.
  # Return the matches for a given Java style regex pattern. Do not include the typical &#x60;/&#x60; at start or end of regex in some languages. Given an example &#x60;your code is: 12345&#x60; the pattern to extract match looks like &#x60;code is: (\\d{6})&#x60;. This will return an array of matches with the first matching the entire pattern and the subsequent matching the groups: &#x60;[&#39;code is: 123456&#39;, &#39;123456&#39;]&#x60; See https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html for more information of available patterns.
