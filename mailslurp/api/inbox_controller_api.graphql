type mutation {
  # Create an Inbox (email address)
  # Create a new inbox and with a randomized email address to send and receive from. Pass emailAddress parameter if you wish to use a specific email address. Creating an inbox is required before sending or receiving emails. If writing tests it is recommended that you create a new inbox during each test method so that it is unique and empty. 
  # @param String! description Optional description for an inbox.
  # @param String! emailAddress Optional email address including domain you wish inbox to use (eg: test123@mydomain.com). Only supports domains that you have registered and verified with MailSlurp using dashboard or &#x60;createDomain&#x60; method.
  # @param String! expiresAt Optional expires at timestamp. If your plan supports this feature you can specify when an inbox should expire. If left empty inbox will exist permanently or expire when your plan dictates
  # @param Boolean! favourite Is inbox favourited.
  # @param String! name Optional name for an inbox.
  # @param [String!] tags Optional tags for an inbox. Can be used for searching and filtering inboxes.
  # @return [Inbox]
  CreateInbox(description: String!, emailAddress: String!, expiresAt: String!, favourite: Boolean!, name: String!, tags: [String!]): Inbox

  # Create an inbox with additional options
  # Additional endpoint that allows inbox creation with request body options. Can be more flexible that other methods for some clients.
  # @param CreateInboxDto createInboxDto createInboxDto
  # @return [Inbox]
  CreateInboxWithOptions(createInboxDto: CreateInboxDto): Inbox

  # Delete all inboxes
  # Permanently delete all inboxes and associated email addresses. This will also delete all emails within the inboxes. Be careful as inboxes cannot be recovered once deleted. Note: deleting inboxes will not impact your usage limits. Monthly inbox creation limits are based on how many inboxes were created in the last 30 days, not how many inboxes you currently have.
  # @return [null]
  DeleteAllInboxes(): null

  # Delete inbox
  # Permanently delete an inbox and associated email address aswell as all emails within the given inbox. This action cannot be undone. Note: deleting an inbox will not affect your account usage. Monthly inbox usage is based on how many inboxes you create within 30 days, not how many exist at time of request.
  # @param ID! inboxId inboxId
  # @return [null]
  DeleteInbox(inboxId: ID!): null

  # Send Email
  # Send an email from an inbox&#39;s email address.  The request body should contain the &#x60;SendEmailOptions&#x60; that include recipients, attachments, body etc. See &#x60;SendEmailOptions&#x60; for all available properties. Note the &#x60;inboxId&#x60; refers to the inbox&#39;s id not the inbox&#39;s email address. See https://www.mailslurp.com/guides/ for more information on how to send emails. This method does not return a sent email entity due to legacy reasons. To send and get a sent email as returned response use the sister method &#x60;sendEmailAndConfirm&#x60;.
  # @param ID! inboxId ID of the inbox you want to send the email from
  # @param SendEmailOptions sendEmailOptions Options for the email
  # @return [null]
  SendEmail(inboxId: ID!, sendEmailOptions: SendEmailOptions): null

  # Send email and return sent confirmation
  # Sister method for standard &#x60;sendEmail&#x60; method with the benefit of returning a &#x60;SentEmail&#x60; entity confirming the successful sending of the email with link the the sent object created for it.
  # @param ID! inboxId ID of the inbox you want to send the email from
  # @param SendEmailOptions sendEmailOptions Options for the email
  # @return [SentEmailDto]

type query {
  # List All Inboxes Paginated
  # List inboxes in paginated form. The results are available on the &#x60;content&#x60; property of the returned object. This method allows for page index (zero based), page size (how many results to return(, and a sort direction (based on createdAt time). You Can also filter by whether an inbox is favorited or use email address pattern. This method is the recommended way to query inboxes. The alternative &#x60;getInboxes&#x60; method returns a full list of inboxes but is limited to 100 results.
  # @param Boolean! favourite Optionally filter results for favourites only
  # @param Int! page Optional page index in inbox list pagination
  # @param String! search Optionally filter by search words partial matching ID, tags, name, and email address
  # @param Int! size Optional page size in inbox list pagination
  # @param String! sort Optional createdAt sort direction ASC or DESC
  # @param String! tag Optionally filter by tags
  # @return [PageInboxProjection]

  # Get emails in an Inbox. This method is not idempotent as it allows retries and waits if you want certain conditions to be met before returning. For simple listing and sorting of known emails use the email controller instead.
  # List emails that an inbox has received. Only emails that are sent to the inbox&#39;s email address will appear in the inbox. It may take several seconds for any email you send to an inbox&#39;s email address to appear in the inbox. To make this endpoint wait for a minimum number of emails use the &#x60;minCount&#x60; parameter. The server will retry the inbox database until the &#x60;minCount&#x60; is satisfied or the &#x60;retryTimeout&#x60; is reached
  # @param ID! inboxId Id of inbox that emails belongs to
  # @param Int! limit Limit the result set, ordered by received date time sort direction. Maximum 100. For more listing options see the email controller
  # @param Int! minCount Minimum acceptable email count. Will cause request to hang (and retry) until minCount is satisfied or retryTimeout is reached.
  # @param Int! retryTimeout Maximum milliseconds to spend retrying inbox database until minCount emails are returned
  # @param String! since Exclude emails received before this ISO 8601 date time
  # @param Int! size Alias for limit. Assessed first before assessing any passed limit.
  # @param String! sort Sort the results by received date and direction ASC or DESC
  # @return [[EmailPreview]]
