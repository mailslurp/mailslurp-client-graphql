type ContentMatchOptions {

  # Java style regex pattern. Do not include the typical &#x60;/&#x60; at start or end of regex in some languages. Given an example &#x60;your code is: 12345&#x60; the pattern to extract match looks like &#x60;code is: (\\d{6})&#x60;. This will return an array of matches with the first matching the entire pattern and the subsequent matching the groups: &#x60;[&#39;code is: 123456&#39;, &#39;123456&#39;]&#x60; See https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html for more information of available patterns.
