# Options for creating a domain to use with MailSlurp. You must have ownership access to this domain in order to verify it. Domains will not function correctly until the domain has been verified. See https://www.mailslurp.com/guides/custom-domains for help. Domains can be either &#x60;HTTP&#x60; or &#x60;SMTP&#x60; type. The type of domain determines which inboxes can be used with it. &#x60;SMTP&#x60; inboxes use a mail server running &#x60;mx.mailslurp.com&#x60; while &#x60;HTTP&#x60; inboxes are handled by AWS SES.

  # The top level domain you wish to use with MailSlurp. Do not specify subdomain just the top level. So &#x60;test.com&#x60; covers all subdomains such as &#x60;mail.test.com&#x60;. Don&#39;t include a protocol such as &#x60;http://&#x60;. Once added you must complete the verification steps by adding the returned records to your domain.
