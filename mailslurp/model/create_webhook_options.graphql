# Options for creating a webhook. Webhooks can be attached to inboxes and MailSlurp will POST a webhook payload to the URL specified whenever the webhook&#39;s event is triggered. Webhooks are great for processing many inbound emails and responding to other events at scale. Customize the payload sent to your endpoint by setting the &#x60;requestBodyTemplate&#x60; property to a string with moustache style variables. Property names from the standard payload model for the given event are available as variables.
