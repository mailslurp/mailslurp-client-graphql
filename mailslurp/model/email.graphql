# Email entity (also known as EmailDto). When an SMTP email message is received by MailSlurp it is parsed. The body and attachments are written to disk and the fields such as to, from, subject etc are stored in a database. The &#x60;body&#x60; contains the email content. If you want the original SMTP message see the &#x60;getRawEmail&#x60; endpoints. The attachments can be fetched using the AttachmentController

  # The body of the email message as text parsed from the SMTP message body (does not include attachments). Fetch the raw content to access the SMTP message and use the attachments property to access attachments.

  # Read flag. Has the email ever been viewed in the dashboard or fetched via the API with a hydrated body? If so the email is marked as read. Paginated results do not affect read status. Read status is different to email opened event as it depends on your own account accessing the email. Email opened is determined by tracking pixels sent to other uses if enable during sending. You can listened for both email read and email opened events using webhooks.
