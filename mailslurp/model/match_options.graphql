# Optional filter for matching emails based on fields. For instance filter results to only include emails whose &#x60;SUBJECT&#x60; value does &#x60;CONTAIN&#x60; given match value. An example payload would be &#x60;{ matches: [{ field: &#39;SUBJECT&#39;, should: &#39;CONTAIN&#39;, value: &#39;Welcome&#39; }] }&#x60;. If you wish to extract regex matches inside the email content see the &#x60;getEmailContentMatch&#x60; method in the EmailController.
type MatchOptions {

  # 1 or more match options. Options are additive so if one does not match the email is excluded from results
  matches: [MatchOption]
