# Conditions to apply to emails that you are waiting for
type WaitForConditions {

  inboxId: ID!

  # Number of results that should match conditions. Either exactly or at least this amount based on the &#x60;countType&#x60;. If count condition is not met and the timeout has not been reached the &#x60;waitFor&#x60; method will retry the operation.
  count: Int!

  # Max time in milliseconds to wait between retries if a &#x60;timeout&#x60; is specified.
  delayTimeout: Int!

  # Max time in milliseconds to retry the &#x60;waitFor&#x60; operation until conditions are met.
  timeout: Int!

  # Apply conditions only to **unread** emails. All emails begin with &#x60;read&#x3D;false&#x60;. An email is marked &#x60;read&#x3D;true&#x60; when an &#x60;EmailDto&#x60; representation of it has been returned to the user at least once. For example you have called &#x60;getEmail&#x60; or &#x60;waitForLatestEmail&#x60; etc., or you have viewed the email in the dashboard.
  unreadOnly: Boolean!

  # How result size should be compared with the expected size. Exactly or at-least matching result?

  sortDirection: SortDirection

  since: String!
