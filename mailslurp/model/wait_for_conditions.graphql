# Conditions that a &#x60;waitForXEmails&#x60; endpoint operates on. The methods wait until given conditions are met or a timeout is reached. If the conditions are met without needing to wait the results will be returned immediately. Can include &#x60;unreadOnly&#x60; to ignore already read emails that were returned in an API call or viewing in the dashboard. Can also include matches for emails containing &#x60;from&#x60;, &#x60;subject&#x60;, &#x60;hasAttachments&#x60; etc.
type WaitForConditions {

  # Number of results that should match conditions. Either exactly or at least this amount based on the &#x60;countType&#x60;. If count condition is not met and the timeout has not been reached the &#x60;waitFor&#x60; method will retry the operation.
  count: Int!

  # How should the found count be compared to the expected count.
  countType: CountType

  # ID of inbox to search within and apply conditions to. Essentially filtering the emails found to give a count.
  inboxId: ID!

  # Conditions that should be matched for an email to qualify for results. Each condition will be applied in order to each email within an inbox to filter a result list of matching emails you are waiting for.
  matches: [MatchOption]

  # ISO Date Time earliest time of email to consider. Filter for matching emails that were received after this date
  since: String!

  # Direction to sort matching emails by created time
  sortDirection: SortDirection

  # Max time in milliseconds to retry the &#x60;waitFor&#x60; operation until conditions are met.
  timeout: Int!

  # Apply conditions only to **unread** emails. All emails begin with &#x60;read&#x3D;false&#x60;. An email is marked &#x60;read&#x3D;true&#x60; when an &#x60;EmailDto&#x60; representation of it has been returned to the user at least once. For example you have called &#x60;getEmail&#x60; or &#x60;waitForLatestEmail&#x60; etc., or you have viewed the email in the dashboard.
  unreadOnly: Boolean!
